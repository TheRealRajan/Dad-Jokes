# Dad-Jokes

A simple **Dad Jokes Generator** that fetches a random dad-joke from *icanhazdadjoke.com*'s API using the Axios library. <br>
The **Get another joke** button sends a *GET request* to the *API server* and fetches another joke.<br><br>
The demo is live at *https://therealrajan.github.io/Dad-Jokes/*
